# Gender_and_Age_Detector
Building a gender and age detector that can approximately guess the gender and age of the person (face) in a photo using Deep Learning on the Adience dataset.

The convolutional neural network for this python project has 3 convolutional layers:

Convolutional layer; 96 nodes, kernel size 7
Convolutional layer; 256 nodes, kernel size 5
Convolutional layer; 384 nodes, kernel size 3
